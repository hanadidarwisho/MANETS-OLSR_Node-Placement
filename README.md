One of the solutions discussed: Solutions at the level of video compression technology where many of the standards that were used in the process of video encoding and that provide good video quality by using a few bits in the coding process as provided us with acceptable bandwidth for the user and are flexible in handling with errors. These standards are: "H. 264/ MPEG-4 part 10".
There was also a solution at the level of routing during the transmission of video in real time over the mobile ad hoc networks so in this paper has been studied OLSR routing protocol that support the transmission of video on the basis of delay, network load and throughput and evaluated the performance by changing the model where the node is located (Node Placement Model) in a large network and in a small network as well as for different video resolutions.
